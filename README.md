Inspired by the app BeReal, where users send a picture of themselves daily, we wanted this social networking app to be a way to connect with our parents and extended families through photo responses to daily prompts.

We realized that parents were not talking to their kids enough, especially when their kids went off to college and beyond. We wanted to provide a platform where families can stay in touch and keep updated with each others' lives.

What it does   
Every day, users receive a prompt. They post a photo related to that prompt. The photo is shared with their family groups.

How we built it
We built it using Swift (frontend) and Firebase (backend).

How to Run      
Connect an iPhone (ios 16 or later preferred) to a computer launching xcode. Update security clerance for the iPhone to allow for developer mode and trust the computer. Build our app on xcode and an app should appear on the phone. 
Note: Tree can be run on the xcode simulator on a computer but the camera function will not show anything for the simulator (which is why we recommend connecting and building on a phone).
